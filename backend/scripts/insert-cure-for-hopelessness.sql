They were to be his people and he would be their God. Their relationship was to be exclusive in their devotion to Him. These were the foundational aspects of the covenant between them. But their worship of foreign Gods ignited God''s anger due to the breaking of the covenant between God and his people. In Jeremiah 17:1-8, God is giving his people a decisive warning regarding their future. Finally, two choices are placed before them - they can choose blessings or curses, all depending on their response to His warning.

The Hopelessness of Sin

God''s desire for his people was that his word would be engraved on their hearts (Jer 31:33). Rather than external evidences like their cultic ceremonies, God desired the internal evidence of His word being "written" on their hearts. Their devotion to God would be an internal factor, from deep within their hearts. But for Judah, it was her sin that was engraved on her heart.

Israel''s sins were not just a fleeting act of misjudgment but a predetermined decisive act on their part. The phrases "engraved with an iron tool" and "inscribed with a flint point" signify the definiteness and severity of their sin. According to the Old Testament concept, it was a "high handed" sin.

The horns of the altar was a place of sanctuary and safety – the altar was to be a place where sins were confessed and atoned for, but here, their sins were inscribed on the horns. Thus we see that their sins find expression even in their worship.

Their sin is being passed on to the next generation. The "remembering" was an important aspect of Israel''s religion. As they performed their rituals, they were to "remember" the mighty deeds of their God Yahweh. But here, the children are remembering their idolatry.

The High Cost of Sin

Several things are endangered because of the sins of God''s people. God''s sanctuary, Israel''s place of worship, will be given away. Here, there is a change in the text to the first person, where God is speaking: "My mountain in the land." Then it changes again to the second person "your high places." God''s mountain refers to the place where the temple of God is located. The high places were the places where Israelites indulged in Idol worship to the gods of the land. Thus God refers to my mountain and your high places. He is distancing himself from the idolatry of the land.

Their national security was compromised due to their sin. The mountains were a more secure place for the people to live. Cities built on the mountains were more difficult to attack. Even the city built on a secure "mountain" would be captured by enemies.

The fruit of their labor was impacted. "your wealth and all your treasures" will be given away. In Deuteronomy, they were warned that when they come to the new land flowing with milk and honey, they were to remember that "it is God who gives you the ability to create wealth." But instead of acknowledging God, they were proud of their prosperity, and considered it the work of their hands.

Their alternate sources of trust were to be avoided. Yahweh was to be their only trust, but Idolatry became a wedge between them and their God "together with your high places." They had found a replacement for the God who had done so much for them.

Their Inheritance was lost. Their inheritance was a divine inheritance...that was irrevocable. But by their own fault, they will loose it. The land was given to them on the basis of the covenant, but now that covenant has been broken...the land will be lost.

Their forefathers were once slaves in a foreign land, and now they will return to slavery. Possession of and dwelling in the land was evidence of their freedom and independence. Now, they will be taken away and enslaved by their enemies.

Intensity of God''s anger is expressed as a warning for the people. They have kindled God''s anger, and "it will burn forever."

The Option of Sin

Two choices are placed before the people. A curse is declared on those who trust in people, self, and reject Yahweh. They will struggle to survive "like a bush in the wastlands." They will miss opportunities that are right before them: "will not see prosperity when it comes." They will experience intense loneliness. "Parched places of the desert" – but isn''t all of the desert "parched?" Finally, their land will become useless: "salt land where no one lives."

Blessings are offered for those who trust in the Lord. Prosperity with an unlimited supply. Unaffected by heat or other dangers that would destroy their crops. All that was promised to the patriarchs will be given to them without any limit. This is the ultimate hope in the midst of Israel''s hopelessness.

Conclusion

Israel never "officially" rejected Yahweh. They just became more syncretestic. This is possibly one of the reasons they were not able to clearly understand and accept the warnings of the prophets. While they worshiped in the temple on "My mountain," they continued their idolatry.

Beware of the subtle nature of the intrusion of sin. The people were not able to detect the prodding of God in their lives. Understand the severe consequences of sin, trusting in sources other than God. Make the right choice and trust only in the Lord. In Him we have hope as we look back at our sins and rebellion. Thus our hopelessness is engulfed by the hope that God gives.
