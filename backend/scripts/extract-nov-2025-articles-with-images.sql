She was about to keep the juice glass on the table that it fell down. Juice was all around the place and Tina was shivering in midst of those shattered glass pieces. Her mom ran from kitchen; grandfather came from outside. All started cleaning up the mess by saying, "why can''t you be still somewhere, why are you always doing something to mess things up. You are such a hard child." After that incident Tina became more inwardly saying no to things around.

This is a scenario commonly seen in many households. When children are around, they create mess and havoc but that''s part of growing up. They fail from spilling water to breaking their own bones at times. As parents who also passed through that age need to be wise and understanding. Failing in life is more important than getting success in life. Failure teaches life lessons that''s an asset for lifetime.

What we learn from failures?

Making mistakes is human: no human has lived in this world who hasn''t done a tiniest mistake in life. When an infant is born, their limbic brain is activated and it takes almost 25 years for their prefrontal cortex to develop fully. Limbic brain is also known as emotional brain whose function is based on several emotional experiences received from internal and external environment. Prefrontal cortex helps a person in decision making, problem solving, planning, organizing, all kinds of executive functions. So, a child, a tween, teen, early adult making mistakes is considered normal and natural path of growth. If this isn''t happening it is an abnormality. Unfortunately, these natural growth ways are mistaken as failures, mistakes, undiagnosed misconduct. As Christian parents, we must trust the creation process of God and acknowledge our children''s growth pattern. This needs immense grace from God. Unless we receive grace from God, it will be difficult to show grace to our children. It is the grace of God that''s going to strength us and live life authentically as a contented human being (Philippians 4:13).

Failures are opportunities for self-learning: as parents our prime aim is to make our children independent for their life, in order for that to happen, they must learn from their failures. It''s easily said, right! When our children fail, let''s make that moment a safe space to teach them their strengths and weakness so that they can trust themselves and correct it their own next time. They must know their areas of weakness so as to use their strength. If we make failures a license to accuse or blame our children, they will fear to live, get disconnected and distanced from us which is a source of many unrecoverable disasters. When one fails, feeling anxious is okay, but trusting God in every such situation is also a learning where we learn gratitude, thanksgiving, being present towards oneself and God (Philippians 4:6).

Failures direct us to reality: imagine a child who is helped in all ways and sees success in everything he or she does! One fine day, due to some reason this individual fails to meet a deadline, misses an event, get lost somewhere and so forth, the breakdown experienced will be terrible. Failures make us realize that there is opportunity for improvement, this is not the end of the world, and to explore various other fields or environments. Parents are protecting children in such a way that they fear to fail, thus children live in a fantasy world of success, trophies, awards but in real world it going to be tough. In reality, we fall and then with hundreds of efforts we get up and stand on our own. It is righteous for one to fall and to rise again but those stubborn natured people resist to admit it and they stumble (Proverbs 24:16).

As grown-ups, we too fail in several instance, nobody might have shown grace towards us just like the man near the pool of Bethesda. For several years, we might have failed to reach that pool of Bethesda for encouragement, for standing up ones in life and living life fruitfully. But we read in Scripture, John 5 that Jesus came to him, understood him, understood how deeply he desired for the grace, how much he wished someone said it''s fine to fail, feel stuck in life, be scared to make first steps, Jesus healed him, accepted him the way he was, acknowledged his life. The grace is all we need to receive and to give. The grace makes us closer to God, especially when we fail miserably to our own expectation and expectations of people around us. Let''s show grace towards the next generation the grace we received from God and the grace we were denied by the world.', 'This article explores the importance of embracing failures in parenting, emphasizing that mistakes are part of growth and how grace from God helps parents and children learn and thrive.', '2025-11-01', 6, TRUE, 'en');
