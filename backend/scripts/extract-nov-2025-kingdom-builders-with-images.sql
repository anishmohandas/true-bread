The day also serves to raise awareness about the importance of children''s rights, education, and welfare, promoting a sense of unity and focusing on child-centered policies. Children are the strength of the nation and should be nurtured with care and affection. Out of the 1.4 billion people, more than 50% of the population is below the age of 25, and more than 65% below the age of 35. In 2020, the average age of an Indian was 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan. Our population is yet faced with poverty, lack of access to quality education, and other evils like child labor, human trafficking, and religious nationalism and communalism are widespread in our country, robbing their dignity and fundamental rights.

For the Church, this carries deeper spiritual significance. It is not just about celebrating children but about recognizing them as precious gifts from God and future builders of His Kingdom. Jesus made this clear when He said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” (Matthew 19:14). Children are not merely the future—they are part of God’s present plan. How we invest in their lives now will shape the spiritual landscape of tomorrow. Raising Kingdom builders means intentionally discipling our children so they grow with a deep love for Jesus, with strong biblical values, and a desire to lead and serve others.

In the Jewish tradition, the home has always been the primary classroom of faith—and mothers, in particular, have often been the first educators of their children. Long before formal instruction in the synagogue or community, children were taught the Shema and the stories of God’s faithfulness at their mother’s knee. Deuteronomy 6: 6–7 commands, “Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.” Faith was not a subject to be learned; it was a way of life to be lived and modeled. Praying together, speaking words of blessing, retelling Scripture, and modeling a life of devotion, the mothers play the first role, and this is God’s design for life. These simple daily practices carry extraordinary weight. Just as generations of Jewish families have passed down their faith through intentional home discipleship, Christian parents today are also called to nurture faith in the ordinary moments—transforming the home into a sacred space of learning, worship, and legacy.

The church also plays a vital role in nurturing and strengthening a child’s faith. A community where they are seen, heard, and valued. Creating an intentional, sacred, and safe space where questions can be asked and faith can be nurtured alongside adults that which is focused on equipping children to lead. Our communities, unfortunately, celebrate ignorance and outdated dogmas as if they were marks of faithfulness, rather than obstacles to spiritual growth. This makes the church risk becoming stagnant—a place where inherited ideas go unquestioned and new generations feel silenced rather than empowered. True discipleship calls us not to worship old forms but to continually seek the living Christ, allowing Scripture and the Spirit to guide us into deeper understanding and faithful action. A healthy church honors its heritage, but it also humbly recognizes when it must grow, learn, and reform. Our faith must be rooted in Scripture, reason, and tradition alongside experience. The true spiritual encounters were never meant to stand alone; they were to be examined, tested, and matured through thoughtful reflection and biblical grounding. Sometimes we make the mistake of elevating emotional or supernatural individual experiences above theological reasoning. In other words, our authentic spiritual experiences should not replace critical reflection—they should inspire it. A mature faith holds both the fire of the Spirit and the light of reason, ensuring that our encounters with God build up the church rather than become stumbling blocks.

Early childhood is a crucial stage where identity, values, and beliefs are formed. Children learn first not through formal teaching, but through attachment, observation, and modeled behavior. When parents and faith communities intentionally shape this environment with love, security, and clear spiritual values, they build a strong foundation for resilience, emotional health, and faith maturity. The tragic reality is that around 90% of child sexual abuse victims know their abuser; in other words, abuse is often perpetrated by people the child already trusts or depends on. Once the trust is broken not by strangers but by people the child knows and trusts, including parents, relatives, family friends, caregivers, teachers, and others in positions of authority or close contact. This impact creates emotional trauma (anxiety, depression), trust issues, behavioral consequences, and proper moral development. This highlights the importance of education, awareness, and creating safe environments where children feel empowered to report inappropriate behavior—even from those they know.

The ultimate goal is not simply to raise physically healthy children, but focus on the holistic development of emotional, intellectual, spiritual and physical aspect of life at the same time to raise disciples who will carry the kingdom of God further than we could. The future of the church is not waiting to be discovered but it is waiting to be discipled. It is relevant as John Wesley’s states: "Give me one hundred men who love only God with all their heart and hate only sin with all their heart and we will shake the gates of hell and bring in the kingdom of God in one generation". If we paraphrase these words it could be “Give me one generation of children who love God and their neighbor, and hate sin and we can transform the world.” As we pour into children with prayer, wisdom and love, we are sowing seeds that will bear fruit for generation.

As we celebrate Children’s Day, let us renew our commitment to raise Kingdom builders—children who know Jesus personally, walk in His ways, and lead others to Him. The future of the Church depends not on programs but on discipleship that begins in the home and grows in the community of faith. May we faithfully invest in the next generation, trusting that God will multiply the seeds we plant for His glory.', 'This article emphasizes the importance of raising children as Kingdom builders through intentional discipleship, highlighting the roles of home and church in nurturing faith, and addressing challenges like child safety.', '2025-11-01', 8, TRUE, 'en');
