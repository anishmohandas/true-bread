In today''s world, where diet trends, fast food, and chronic illness are on the rise, many struggle to understand what healthy eating truly looks like. But when we turn to the Bible, we find timeless wisdom that speaks into even our modern-day food choices.

1. Our Bodies Are God''s Temple
"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit... Therefore, honor God with your bodies." – 1 Corinthians 6:19-20
As a dietitian, I often encourage people to care for their bodies through balanced nutrition, hydration, and rest. When we understand our bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit, our motivation shifts from appearance to worship. Choosing whole foods, avoiding harmful habits, and respecting our health becomes a spiritual act of stewardship.

2. God Designed Food with Purpose
"Then God said, ''I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth... They will be yours for food.''" – Genesis 1:29
God created fruits, vegetables, grains, and other natural foods for our nourishment. Modern science now confirms the power of these foods to fight disease, boost energy, and support mental health. Eating closer to the way God originally intended—minimally processed, plant-rich diets—can lead to greater well-being.

3. Moderation and Self-Control Are Key
"Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control."–Proverbs25:28
Even healthy food, when consumed in excess or for the wrong reasons, can lead to imbalance. As Christians, we are called to practice self-control—not legalism, but wise boundaries. Eating with purpose, rather than emotional impulse or overindulgence, honors both our health and our faith.

4. Gratitude Transforms Our Relationship with Food
"So, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." – 1 Corinthians 10:31
Food is not to be worshiped, feared, or abused—it is to be received with thanksgiving. Whether we are enjoying a simple meal or a feast, approaching the table with gratitude can change our entire mindset. As a dietitian, I encourage clients to slow down, bless their food, and eat mindfully.

God cares deeply about every part of us—body, mind, and spirit. As Christians, let us not separate our health from our faith. Whether we''re planning meals, feeding our families, or teaching others about nutrition, we have an opportunity to reflect God''s wisdom and love.

May we seek balance, practice self-care, and glorify God in every bite we take.', 'A Christian perspective on healthy eating as spiritual stewardship, connecting nutrition with honoring God.', '2025-08-01', 8, TRUE, 'en');

('the-youth-in-exile', 'The Youth In Exile', 'Renji Sam', NULL, NULL, 'Youth', 'assets/images/articles/youth-exile.jpg', 'Illustration representing Christian youth in a secular world', 'It was a cold Wednesday evening. A 17-year-old girl sat on the edge of her bed, scrolling through her phone. Her feed was filled with influencers talking about body image, identity, and freedom. Her friends posted videos mocking religion as irrelevant, outdated, even oppressive. She had grown up in Sunday schools, loved Jesus deeply- but now she felt alone. Her beliefs made her feel like a stranger in her own generation. This is the silent story of many young people today. They are not in physical exile, but like Israel in Babylon, they feel emotionally and spiritually displaced. The exiles in a world that no longer speaks the language of their faith.

Jesus the Cultural Exile: for many Christian youth, being a believer today means navigating a world that doesn''t understand or value their convictions. From school classrooms to Instagram comments from peer circles to universities, they are often challenged to prove their faith. Even in the spiritual surroundings they are constantly facing questions and suspicious looks which makes them self-doubt their dignity. Being in a youthful age itself is a challenge because of the widespread perspective that youngsters are prow to fall or go astray. They get confused because it is told to them that this world is theirs, family is behind them, church is praying for them, but whereas they stand, they get rejected and misplaced. They could hardly speak their mind due to the fear of rejection.

John15:18-19 "If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."

He was not the right pick for the society and culture in which he lived. He walked the paths of death because he stood different from the crowd. When youngsters feel lost and unwanted, the encouragement to share is Christ himself. Instead of going after alternatives to prove himself as God, Jesus lived a life of purity, clarity and sincerity. He was questioned, rebuked, wounded but he modeled a life of purpose remembering all the generations coming after him, the millennials, the GenZ, the Alpha''s and the Beta''s.

Daniel: He was a role model in a hostile culture. Daniel was stripped off his name, language, temple, and community. Yet he remained faithful. Daniel made choices to say no to feast or dine with king. He studied its literature, worked in its government, and influenced its kings- all without compromising his identity in God. Daniel made all these choices of his own. He had a hard time because his choices made him stand out in crowd. Our youngsters too make choices among their friends, peers or society. They are already under lot of social pressures. The biggest challenge they face is when their own doesn''t trust them and their choices.

The freedom to use the wisdom that God has given them is not trusted which destroys their confidence to live a life of trusting God. They might be thinking differently, living colorfully, saying no to many traditional things but are they still in the journey with God? Every time we judge their choices, we are making clearing that we don''t trust the work God is doing in them. This triggers them to indulge in crimes, havoc and silly decisions.

Proverbs 18:15 "The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge."

The position that one reaches about the spiritual expulsion must be dealt wisely. Arrogance and stubbornness blinds people with pride and false truth that makes them avoid seeking knowledge appropriately. This requires one to have discernment, discernment over emotions, discernment over social setups, discernment in relationships, discernment over their spiritual leads. This is a lifelong process.

The Crisis of Identity: Esther faced huge identity crisis. She had to hide her family identity, and national identity. Finally, she had to "come out" which was life threatening. Coming out with your truth is the new age boundary setting. Youngsters who assertively communicate who they are might face challenge, but it builds a standard wall of protection from influencers, trends, miscommunications, and social pressures. They need to rediscover who they are not based on followers, fame and passing feelings. The steps they step back from setting boundaries and to pleasing people will backfire as it will disrupt their personality as a whole. The increased rate of depression and anxiety issues among youngsters is an alarming call saying they are doing something which isn''t engraved in their personality.

Galatians 6:2 "Bear one another''s burden and so fulfill the law of Christ."

Loneliness and isolation tenses one to question their identity. That''s why one needs their own tribes for support. In an age where everyone is questioning their existence, this burden can be reduced through open forums for discussions and communication where one is accepted than judged, than contempt. This is a universal need which needs to be created, a safe space for all types of people. Identifying crisis is a huge skill but sharing it with right people and getting help on time are life savers.

The question to all of us readers is: are we listening, are we mentoring and are we offering grace and truth or just tradition. Jesus walked with the outcast, sat with the doubting, died for the lost and welcomed the questioning. Let''s create youth spaces where testimonies are raw, worship is deep, and struggles are met with prayer, not performance. Let''s remind our young exiles that they are not alone and never forgotten. This journey of exile started in all generation, few settled in the wilderness, few expelled themselves, few held hope, few transferred the traumas to next generation but the greatly hope lies at the promises God has for the coming generation, a generation that shows dislikes, that are not scared of falling or failing, who raise hands for help and portrays vulnerability.

The word "Blessed" carries a wide range of meanings. Beyond its religious roots, it''s often associated with good fortune, envy, and luck—especially when experiencing positive outcomes, achieving goals, or enjoying comfort. The term is commonly linked to abundance, health, successful careers, attractive partners, loving children, spacious homes, supportive friends, and long life—qualities that many see as signs of being blessed. Some Christian preachers emphasize prosperity as a key aspect of blessedness. However, the biblical understanding of "blessed" has a deeper, more profound significance. While material blessings are indeed expressions of God''s favor, the Bible''s definition of blessedness goes beyond superficial riches. What are the true markers of blessedness according to Scripture? In the Gospel of Matthew, blessedness is described differently from worldly views. Examining the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3–10) reveals a concept of blessing that sharply contrasts with popular interpretations.

Beatitudes
The term "beatitude" comes from the Latin Vulgate translation of the Greek word makarios, meaning "fortunate," "happy," "enlarged," or "long-lasting." This form of expression, starting with "blessed is/are...," is especially prominent in the Old Testament. In wisdom literature, it encourages a path of righteousness; in prophetic writings, it expresses trust in God''s action to address current injustices; and in historical texts, it signifies God''s favor toward kings or the people. The beatitudes appear in both Matthew 5 and Luke 6, with Luke offering a more concise version of Matthew. Specifically, the beatitudes in Matthew 5:3–12 can be seen as a detailed restatement of Matthew 4:17, where Jesus begins his ministry with the call to repentance, framing the kind of life expected of the citizens of God''s kingdom. A beatitude is a statement that both declares and celebrates God''s positive action toward an individual. Each of the eight (or, for some scholars, nine) beatitudes stands as a promise from God to the marginalized, assuring them that they are heirs of His kingdom. These declarations seem to reflect the historical experiences of God''s people during exile and beyond, expressing a deep longing for divine intervention to restore order and hope.

The well-known structure of the Beatitudes, as seen in passages like Psalms 1:1–3 and 128:1–4, typically consists of two parts. The first identifies who receives God''s blessing—such as "the poor in spirit," "those who mourn," and others—while the second describes the way that blessing is expressed, for example, "theirs is the kingdom of heaven," "they will be comforted," and so on.

"Poor in spirit" refers to individuals who, recognizing their deep need, turn to God for help (cf. Ps 34:18). "Those who mourn" are those troubled by evil''s presence in the world and their own shortcomings. "The meek" are people who reject the pursuit of power and instead adopt a humble, childlike attitude, choosing to serve others. "Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness" long to see goodness and justice ultimately prevail in the world and within their own lives. "The merciful" are quick to help those in need, forgiving others—even their enemies—and judging others with compassion. The "pure in heart," as described in Psalm 73:1, are individuals whose hearts remain untainted, recognizing that only God is their true source of help and reward. The peacemakers prioritize restoring harmony, willing to set aside their own rights and interests, and they overcome evil with good (cf. Rom 12:21).

The marginalized and persecuted—those who are poor in spirit, mourners, and meek—are promised a place in the kingdom of heaven. Given the context of Jesus'' audience, this also likely refers to those suffering under Roman oppression. Therefore, the Beatitudes can be understood within the socio-political realities of the original listeners, highlighting the profound contrast between the values of God''s kingdom and the prevailing norms of their society.

Historical Situation
Matthew''s community existed under significant social and political pressure. Roman rule imposed heavy taxation, military presence, and the threat of violence, while local Jewish authorities, having accommodated imperial power, were often complicit in the resulting inequities. Formerly autonomous under the Hasmoneans, Judaea had become a marginalized Roman province. Daily life was marked by authoritarian governance, economic disparity, and widespread discontent. Many longed-for deliverance, interpreting Jesus'' teachings—particularly the beatitudes—as a response to deep-seated poverty and systemic injustice.

Following the Temple''s destruction in 70 CE, the Pharisees assumed a central role in redefining Judaism, enforcing boundaries regarding purity and ritual observance. Jesus, by contrast, prioritized internal moral transformation over ritual compliance.

Consequently, Matthew''s community faced exclusion from synagogues and social marginalization, particularly due to their openness to Gentiles. Their faith entailed the risk of isolation and persecution, sustained by the expectation of divine intervention and restoration.

Counter narrative
The Beatitudes have traditionally been interpreted as articulations of moral virtues or attitudes esteemed by God within the Kingdom of Heaven. However, a more nuanced reading emerges when Matthew''s presentation of the Beatitudes is situated within the socio-political context of his audience, particularly against the realities of exploitation and the revolutionary activities of Jewish nationalists who sought to establish the Kingdom of God through force. Among many first-century Jews, there existed a prevailing expectation that the kingdom would be inaugurated through violent conflict and military confrontation, as evidenced by sporadic revolts and significant wars against Roman authority.

Contrary to these prevailing assumptions, Jesus extends the promise of the Kingdom not to the politically or militarily ambitious, but rather to the "poor in spirit" (Matthew 5:3), the "meek" (5:5), and the "peacemakers" (5:9). In this framework, it is those who exhibit humility and patience before God—as opposed to those who pursue the kingdom through coercive means—who are assured of "inheriting the earth."

For the subjugated Palestinian village communities, Jesus'' proclamation of the Kingdom functioned as a source of solace and hope. The advent of God''s deliverance in the person of Jesus signaled the nearness of the Kingdom, offering blessings to the persecuted and implying judgment upon oppressors. This conviction that God was actively engaged in socio-political realities served to renew the hope of marginalized communities in the transformative mission of Jesus. The apocalyptic imagery associated with these teachings provided a vision of future hope for communities living under Roman domination.

Moreover, the Beatitudes are inherently countercultural. They challenge the prevailing cultural norms by presenting a vision of fulfillment that stands in stark contrast to the pursuit of status and success valued by contemporary society. Rather than advocating the emulation of societal icons, Jesus'' teachings in the Beatitudes affirm that true fulfillment of human desire is found in knowing God, being counted among his children, receiving divine comfort and satisfaction, and ultimately dwelling in God''s presence. In this way, the Beatitudes provide a transformative critique of cultural values and reorient the trajectory of human aspiration.

Conclusion
Blessedness represents a spiritual condition characterized by well-being and prosperity—a profound, joy-infused contentment that remains unshaken by poverty, sorrow, famine, persecution, conflict, or any other challenges or tragedies encountered in life. Those who are blessed may either be victims of oppression or serve as a counter-narrative to the story of oppression. The Beatitudes embody the way God desires his redeemed creation to function within the Kingdom of Heaven. The operation of God''s kingdom is not governed by the violent, powerful, or mighty, but rather by the poor, humble, and similar figures. These eight blessings articulated by Jesus offer crucial insights into a life marked by compassion, humility, and purpose. Consequently, the Beatitudes should not be viewed merely as a compilation of virtues, but rather as a transformative critique of a culture that requires a fundamental shift.', 'Exploring the deeper meaning of biblical blessedness in the Beatitudes as a counter-narrative to worldly definitions of success and prosperity.', '2025-08-01', 15, TRUE, 'en');
