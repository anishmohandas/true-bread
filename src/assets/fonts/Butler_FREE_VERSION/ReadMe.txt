OTF vs TTF format
-----------------
Please note that the OTF file standard, as it is the modern standard for font files, is
not fully supported by some old softwares, nor a few others such as Word and Powerpoint.
The fonts will work, but some bugs or deactivated features such as kerning might happen.
In that case, please install the ".ttf" files instead of the ".otf" files.
