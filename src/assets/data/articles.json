      "content": "\"One day, I was traveling with my family in an auto-rickshaw. My father started talking to the auto-driver about Jesus Christ, while the driver, a kind man, shared his experiences from his faith. He mentioned that he used to be an ambulance driver and had traveled all over India, accumulating a lot of life experiences. Even now, as an auto driver, he still prays whenever he passes by a temple, mosque, or church.\" (18th June 2024)\n\nThis isn't something unusual; we often hear similar feelings from spiritual people. I've heard it many times from my school and college friends as well. It made me reflect—if an ordinary man–woman can genuinely pray to any deity regardless of the religious differences, why can't Christians worship and praise God together, despite belonging to different Christian traditions?\n\nIn today's world, we see Christians divided by denominations, traditions, and practices. Some prefer traditional hymns, while others embrace contemporary worship. Some follow strict liturgical practices, while others adopt a more informal approach. These differences, though meaningful in their own right, sometimes create barriers that prevent us from experiencing the full richness of Christian fellowship.\n\nThe Bible speaks clearly about unity among believers. In John 17:21, Jesus prays, \"that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.\" This prayer reveals God's heart for His church—a unified body of believers who, despite their differences, come together in worship and fellowship.\n\nWhen we look at the early church in Acts, we see a beautiful picture of unity: \"They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer\" (Acts 2:42). This unity wasn't based on uniformity in practices but on their shared faith in Christ and love for one another.\n\nPerhaps we can learn something from that auto driver's simple yet profound approach to spirituality. His ability to express his faith, regardless of the religious setting, reminds us that true worship comes from the heart. While we must maintain sound doctrine and biblical truth, we should also recognize that God's family is larger and more diverse than our individual traditions might suggest.\n\nHere are some practical ways we can promote Christian unity while respecting our diverse traditions:\n\n1. Focus on Common Ground:\nInstead of emphasizing our differences, let's focus on what unites us—our faith in Jesus Christ, our commitment to Scripture, and our call to love and serve others.\n\n2. Learn from Each Other:\nEach Christian tradition has unique insights and practices that can enrich our faith. We can learn from the contemplative practices of some traditions, the passionate worship of others, and the strong emphasis on Scripture found in yet others.\n\n3. Pray Together:\nPrayer has a way of breaking down barriers and building bridges. When we pray together, our denominational differences often fade in the light of God's presence.\n\n4. Serve Together:\nWorking side by side in service to others can help us appreciate each other's gifts and perspectives while demonstrating Christian unity to the world.\n\n5. Practice Humility:\nRecognizing that no single denomination or tradition has a monopoly on truth can help us approach our differences with humility and grace.\n\nThe auto driver's story reminds us that sometimes the simplest expressions of faith can teach us profound truths. His ability to pray sincerely, regardless of the religious setting, challenges us to think about how we as Christians can better demonstrate unity in our diversity.\n\nAs we move forward, let's remember that our unity in Christ doesn't require us to abandon our traditions or distinctive practices. Instead, it calls us to recognize and celebrate the various ways God works through different Christian traditions while maintaining our essential unity in Christ.\n\nMay we learn to worship together, not just in words but in spirit and truth, demonstrating to the world that our love for Christ and each other transcends denominational boundaries. After all, in heaven, we won't be separated by denominations but united in perfect worship of our Lord and Savior.\n\nAs the Psalmist writes, \"How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity!\" (Psalm 133:1). Let this be our prayer and our goal as we seek to be the unified body of Christ that Jesus prayed for.",

      "excerpt": "Exploring the challenges and triumphs of the first woman, Eve, and the valuable lessons her life offers to women today...",
      "content": "Biblical Women, beginning from the first woman, faced various crises and challenges, connected with their personal lives, families, or nation. Some of them overcame it with the help of God, while others failed miserably. Their stories remind us of the importance of relying on God in times of crisis and trusting in Him for strength and guidance. These stories witness the power and grace of God. As we celebrate Women's Day, the lives of women in the Bible offer valuable insights into not only the crisis women face but also their resilience and victory across generations.\n\nThis article looks at the story of the first woman, Eve. Genesis chapters 2 to 4 describe various crises in her life. The following struggles and crises in Eve's life mirror the life of many women today.\n\n1. Temptation\nThe serpent tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden. The serpent questioned God's command not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, casting doubt on God's intentions and authority. She was lured by the idea that eating the fruit would make her \"like God, knowing good and evil\" (Genesis 3:5).\n\n2. Disobedience\nEve gave in to temptation, ate the forbidden fruit, and gave some to Adam. This act of doubt, rebellion, and disobedience was the first sin, often called \"The Fall.\"\n\n3. Judgement\nAfter the sin, Eve and Adam experienced shame and tried to hide from God. God pronounced judgment: Pain in childbirth would increase and her relationship with Adam would involve struggle and imbalance.\nThey were expelled from the Garden of Eden, losing their perfect communion with God.\n\n4. Sibling Rivalry and Sin\nCain, Eve's firstborn, became jealous of his brother Abel because God accepted only Abel's offering. This jealousy led Cain to murder Abel, committing the first act of human violence.\n\n5. Grief and Loss\nThe murder has caused havoc in the family. Eve experienced the unimaginable pain of losing Abel to death and Cain to sin and separation. Cain was cursed and sent away to wander, which would have deepened Eve's sorrow as a mother.\n\nBut the story of Eve does not end there. It is a story of the triumph of a woman at the mercy of God. She continued to live and God blessed her with generations of sons and daughters.\n\nHow Eve Overcame these crisis with God\n\n1. Acknowledgement of Sin\nWhen God came in search of her, Eve admitted her role, saying, \"The serpent deceived me, and I ate\" (Genesis 3:13). This acknowledgement is an important step toward restoration.\n\n2. God's Mercy and Provision\nDespite the consequences of their sin, God showed mercy: He clothed Adam and Eve with garments of skin, signifying care and covering their shame. He promised a future Redeemer in Genesis 3:15, indicating that through Eve's offspring, sin and Satan would ultimately be defeated.\n\n3. Faith in God's Promise\nEve demonstrated trust in God's promise when she named her firstborn, Cain, saying, \"With the help of the Lord, I have brought forth a man\" (Genesis 4:1).\n\n4. Hope for Redemption\nEve's story is woven into the larger biblical narrative of redemption. Her offspring would eventually lead to Jesus Christ, who provides salvation for all.\n\n5. God's Justice and Mercy\nGod confronted Cain about his sin, showing that He is just and holds people accountable. However, God also placed a mark on Cain to protect him, showing mercy even to the sinner. This act demonstrated to Eve that God's justice is balanced with His grace.\n\n6. God's Promise Sustained Her Hope\nIn Genesis 3:15, God promised that her offspring would ultimately crush the serpent's head, pointing to a future Redeemer. This promise gave Eve hope despite the tragedy in her family.\n\n7. The Birth of Seth\nAfter Abel's death and Cain's exile, Eve bore another son, Seth. She declared, \"God has granted me another child in place of Abel since Cain killed him\" (Genesis 4:25).\nNoah came from the lineage of Seth and eventually Jesus came, fulfilling God's redemptive plan.\n\n8. Faith in God's Sovereignty\nEve trusted that God was, still in control and that His purposes would prevail despite the evil and suffering she witnessed\n\nLessons for us today from Eve's life\n\nThe following lessons from Eve's life can speak volumes to today's women.\n\n1. The Reality of Sin: No one can neglect the effect of sin. Sin affects not only individuals but also families and communities. So we must stay grounded in God's Word to recognise and reject lies.\n\n2. Confess and Repent: Like Eve, acknowledging our sins is essential for reconciliation with God.\n\n3. Faith Amid Pain: Eve's trust in God's faithfulness amid grief and loss is a lesson to find strength in God's promises when we face grief and loss.\n\n4. Trust in God's Plan: The Birth of Seth reminds us of the surety of God's promises even in the darkest times. Even in the face of sin and its judgement in our failures, God's mercy and redemptive plan are at work. God's provision and promises are greater than our mistakes. God's justice and mercy never change.\n\nAs we celebrate Women's Day, Eve's story reminds us that women are not defined by their struggles and challenges but by God's grace and redemption. Women's strength, faith, and resilience will continue to shape the world today. God who remembered Eve and redeemed her, is the One who defines the worth, purpose, and destiny of women in all generations.\n\nHappy Women's Day",

      "excerpt": "A profound reflection on Kevin Carter's haunting 1993 photograph from Sudan, exploring its impact on humanity and the Christian response to suffering in our world...",
      "content": "Some of you might remember the image titled: The Vulture and the Little Girl, 1993, originally titled: Struggling Girl or The Vulture is Hungry. This image put tears into the eyes of humanity. The vulture is waiting for the girl to die and to eat her flesh, both are hungry. This photograph was taken by South African photojournalist, Kevin Carter, while on assignment to Sudan, near the village of Ayod. Careful not to disturb the bird, he waited for 20 long minutes until the vulture was close enough, positioned himself for the best possible image, to get the two in focus, the hungry child and the hungry bird. At that time Kevin Carter was likely unaware that he had captured one of the most controversial photographs in the history of photojournalism and took this photo from approximately 10 meters.\n\nLater on when this photograph was sold to The New York Times, when it appeared for the first time on March 26, 1993, overnight hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask what happened to the child. Whether the child survive? (Photo credit: Kevin Carter). The newspaper made a special editorial note saying the girl had enough strength to walk away from the vulture, but that her ultimate fate was unknown. Later on, this dramatic photographer received a lot of criticism, Kevin Carter was vehemently criticized for not helping that girl and walking away from the scene after completing his mission. The St. Petersburg Times in Florida wrote: \"The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering, might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene.\" Two vultures are there and one is behind the camera hiding. The attitude matters, yet the photojournalists were told not to touch the famine victims for fear of spreading diseases. Carter estimated during those years, there were twenty people per hour dying at the food center due to starvation.\n\nLater on, Carter committed suicide due to guilt, depression, and lack of financial resources. He said: \"I'm really sorry. The pain of life overrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist… I am depressed… without a phone… money for rent … money for child support… money for debts… money!!!… I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings and corpses and anger and pain… of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners… I have gone to join Ken Oosterbroek [recently deceased colleague] if I am that lucky\". Of course, dying or suicide is not a solution, he could have had a new storyline, transformed narrative, or rewritten his story for help and standing for the poor and needy.\n\nJesus said to his disciples \"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. Blessed are you when people hate you when they exclude you insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.\" (Luke: 6: 17-26)\n\nThis is Luke's version of the sermon on the Mount, the Sermon on the Plain. This contains the Beatitudes, and it is presented in the context of bringing the good news to the gentles. To a Greco-Roman audience, addressing Theophilus, physician Luke's account of the gospel appears to be geared towards Gentiles, those in the Hellenistic context. This also has wider significance in the context of the universality, Hellenistic universality in the gospel. While Matthew's account shows enormous emphasis on the fulfillment of the Old Testament scriptures, presenting Jesus as the fulfillment of the messianic kingdom, Luke presents a universal Savior. Luke specifically calls Jesus a light to the Gentiles in Luke 2. In chapter 3 Luke quotes Isaiah 40 by stating that 'all flesh will see God's salvation.'\n\nIt was Friedrich Nietzsche who once said: To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. The good news of the gospel is the good news to the poor as the Latin vulgate, (the principal Latin version of the Bible, prepared mainly by St. Jerome in the late 4th century) calls it 'beati,' which translates to be happy, rich, or blessed. The corresponding Greek word is μακάριοι (Makarioi) which means blessed.\n\nWe have so many words in our everyday vocabulary all centered on ourselves. Self-esteem, self-confidence, self-advertisement, self-gratification, self-glorification, self-motivation, self-pity, self-applause, self-centeredness, self-indulgence, self-righteousness, and so forth. At the same time, we are ignorant about our bondage, our shortcomings, our sinfulness, our guilt, our behavioral pattern, our disconnection from reality, and our rebellion. The tragedy of our culture today is that we all know that we are in a sinking ship yet we stand still and watch and wonder. Gospel promotes a counter-culture perspective and an upside-down kingdom. This is an invitation to deeper discipleship with Jesus. Just like Katherine Hawker says, Happy are we when our treasures cannot be quantified. Happy are we when our knowledge is tempered by mystery? Happy are we when our pain is held in the balm of love. Happy are we when our delight comes from beyond ourselves.\n\nThe gospel is the lifeblood of Christianity and it provides the foundation for countering and confronting culture. Gospel offers a counterculture way of life and it sets attitudes opposed to the prevailing social norm. We all live in the paradox of our humanness. We are both noble and ignoble, we are both rational and irrational, we are both moral and immoral, we are both creative and destructive, we are both loving and selfish, innovative and copycat, we are both Godlike and beast-like or barbaric. We are the same generation that built hospitals for the care of the sick, universities for the acquisition of knowledge, cars, airplanes, and other vehicles for transportation, and beautiful churches for the worship of God, but we also have built concentration camps, torture chambers, nuclear weapons for mass destruction and closed our churches and made restriction not to gather. We are a self-centered generation. How do we transition from a self-centered ego-centric life to a God-centered (Theo-centered) life? Yes for many everything is centered around them, for some everything is geo-centric or cosmo-centric, the question is how do you live in this world God-centered? \"I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ,\" said Mahatma Gandhi the Father of our nation. Let's make sure we work hard to make Mahatma Gandhi wrong. Let this generation say I like your Christ and I like you just like first-century disciples in Antioch called \"Christians,\" which essentially means \"little Christ.\" Acts 11:26.",

      "content": "Parenting is a journey unlike any other- a road paved with sleepless nights, heartwarming smiles and countless lessons learned along the way. It is a dance of love, patience, and resilience, where every step shapes not just the child but also the parent. In this intricate tapestry of life, grace becomes the golden thread- a quiet yet powerful force that softens mistakes, bridges gaps, and nurtures connections. Grace is the whisper that reminds us to accept imperfections, to pause when temper rise, and to love unconditionally even when the days feel long and challenging. Grace is when parents are able to silence their inner voice of doubt, conflict and impatience and lend their ears and heart towards their children’s cry for attention, support and understanding at any age. Imagine a garden, where each child is a seed, unique in its own right. Some sprout quickly while others take their time, quietly growing roots unseen. Parent becomes the gardener that tends to the needs of each seed, providing care and grace as a gentle rain, nourishing the soil and souls. These series of article are an invitation to the parents to embrace grace-filled parenting- where love and understanding triumph over control, mistakes become opportunities and goal is not perfection but connection. Parent’s must thrive the grace to let go. In today’s world were evil stems deeper, parents feel the urge to hold on to their children closer tightly. Their fear embarks their children’s future. It is a natural instinct to protect our children from the influence of sin and evil. Here, our spiritual perception brings out the true faith in us. A grace-filled parent will always know that God’s grace extends beyond their physical control. Parents at this ripe hour needs to exhibit their faith by rendering their children to the Lord who gave them to us, trusting God’s goodness, entrusting them to Him to mature their faith.Psalm 121:1,3,5 says, “Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it; Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain”. God assures to teach our children Himself. This doesn’t undermine our parental role or endeavor. What Scripture tends to say is God has His own ways to their hearts. His loving touch will transform our endless effort and make them powerful and fruitful. Parents anxiety, fear, stress may be felt as vain because children don’t see it as a godly grace but as nagging and forcing. This will make our efforts go in vain. Parents teach truth, model grace and love unconditionally, but it is God who tests and proves our children’s faith. God’s purifying and refining process is necessary for them to go on to spiritual maturity. As James 1:3-4 says, “the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing”. Does that sound like Christian parenting? Our faith gets demonstrated in our gracious Father, every single time by having the grace to let go and trust Him to complete the good works that He has begun in our children (Romans 14:10). We have living testimonies around us. Marriage is God’s perfect picture of expressing his undying love for humanity. He is our Heavenly Bridegroom and we, the church, are His bride. Marriage is the perfect gift to humankind, same way a family models God’s grace as we learn to serve one another, including our children from infancy to adulthood, with a heart of gratitude for the One who loves us more than any human bonds. It is a period of self-growth, discipline and heavenly progress for the parent more than for the child. Parents goes through a purification stage that showcases areas of strength and weakness untold to others. That is the graceful guidance God has towards us, where He never steps back from connecting with us in all stages of life. Word for Parental Encouragement Isaiah 54: 13, “All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”.",
